# DineDiverse: Personalized Restaurant Discovery

## Project Purpose

DineDiverse is a mobile-first web application designed to help users discover the best local restaurants based on their unique preferences and critically important dietary restrictions. It aims to solve the market gap of fragmented, unreliable, and incomplete information for diners with allergies, intolerances, or specific lifestyle diets.

## Technology Stack and Market Gap Exploitation

Our technology stack is carefully selected to directly address the identified market gaps and provide a competitive advantage:

*   **Frontend: React with TypeScript & Tailwind CSS**
    *   **React:** Enables building a dynamic, responsive, and interactive user interface crucial for handling complex filtering options and presenting restaurant data effectively. Its component-based architecture facilitates a clean and maintainable UI for managing diverse dietary profiles.
    *   **TypeScript:** Provides static typing, which is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of dietary restriction data. This mitigates errors common in handling complex, multi-faceted user profiles and restaurant attributes, directly addressing the need for trustworthy information for critical dietary needs.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** Allows for rapid UI development and consistent styling, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. This helps reduce the cognitive load for users trying to input detailed preferences and navigate search results.

*   **Backend: Node.js with Express.js & TypeScript**
    *   **Node.js/Express.js:** Offers a high-performance, non-blocking I/O model ideal for real-time data fetching and API responsiveness. This is critical for an application that needs to serve up-to-date menu and ingredient information.
    *   **TypeScript:** Enhances backend code maintainability and robustness, ensuring data integrity and secure handling of sensitive user preference and dietary information.

*   **Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM**
    *   **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, reliable, and scalable relational database system. It's well-suited for storing structured data like restaurant information, menus, user profiles, and dietary attributes with high integrity.
    *   **Prisma ORM:** Provides a modern, type-safe database access layer. This simplifies database operations, reduces boilerplate code, and further reinforces type safety for dietary data, aligning with the need for accuracy and reliability.

*   **Search: Elasticsearch**
    *   **Elasticsearch:** A distributed search and analytics engine that enables fast, complex, and relevant search queries. It's crucial for implementing multi-faceted filtering (e.g., "vegan AND gluten-free AND outdoor seating") efficiently, fulfilling the need for comprehensive discovery.

*   **Deployment & Infrastructure: Docker & AWS (ECS/Fargate, RDS)**
    *   **Docker:** Facilitates containerization, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments. This simplifies deployment and management of the application's services.
    *   **AWS (ECS/Fargate, RDS):** Provides a scalable, managed cloud infrastructure. ECS/Fargate offers easy container orchestration, while RDS manages the PostgreSQL database, allowing the platform to scale as user adoption grows and ensuring high availability for critical data.

## Project Structure Overview

The project will follow a modular and scalable structure:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── routes/
│   │   └── services/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── common/
│   │   ├── dietary-filters/
│   │   └── restaurant-cards/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── contexts/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── interfaces/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── App.tsx
│   └── index.tsx
├── prisma/
│   └── schema.prisma
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── docker-compose.yml
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

This structure separates concerns, making it easier to manage, test, and scale different parts of the application. The `src/api` handles backend logic, `src/components` and `src/pages` manage the UI, `prisma` defines the database schema, and configuration is kept in `config` and `.env` files.
